Ansible
===========
ansible is an opensource configuration management tool and also we can use as a Deployment tool,provided by redhat.

Configuration is some task which we want to execute on the server, it can be 

1) CReating Users/Groups ..etc
2)Installing and removing a software/package
3)creating/updating/copying files.
4) start/stop services .etc

Configuration Management tools
Ansible
Chef
Puppet
Saltstack

Two types configuration management tools
=============================================
Push based configuration --> server only push to hosts (Ansible)
Ansible Agent less configuration,Ansible written in a python language.
Pull based configuration --> host only pull from server( with agent software pull) (Chef,Puppet)

Terraform -->Infrastructure as a code
we can provision /modify/destory infrastructure(Network,Servers,storage..etc)


can we install Ansible in windows machine or is Ansible Machine(controller) can be a windows?
No
can we configue windows using ansible?
yes, we can configure windows machine using ansible.

What can Ansible do?
cofiguration management
Continuous delivery

why ansible?
Predefined modules/functionalities.
yml based scripts.
Idempotent(all ready configuration is done it's not modified any thing)
Push Based and Agent less.

Ansible Components:
=====================
Host Inventory --> we can maintain deatils of host machines(Servers) to configure. we can list and group servers(Host Machines)
Two types of Host incentory
----------------------------
Satic Inventory --> It's a file in which we can list host(server)details like IP/HostName, User Name,Password ..etc, we can group the servers.
Default location or path of Host inventory --> /etc/ansible/hosts
Dynamic Inventory --> it's a Script(Python/Sheel) which will fetch host details dyanmically from external source like from Cloud provider, databses etc.

Connection Plugins
-------------------
SSH --> Linux
WINRM -->windows Remote Machine

Playbooks --> It's yaml basedvscript (configuration), play book contains atsks which you want to perform on the servers.
we will usse ansible modules to write the tasks.
Sample:
-hosts: all
 tasks:
 - name: create a user
   user:
    name: mithun
    create_home: yes
    password: Naveen@123
    group: <groupName>

Ansible configuration
------------------------
Create 3 servers 1 for ansible servers 2 for hosts
create Ansible user in server, give user name like ansible,sudo useradd ansible, and give password,sudo passwd ansible,Password Princy@#$2022
bydafult password based authentication not enable in aws,so we have to enable, go to sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 keep like this # To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
#PasswordAuthentication no
restart the service sudo service sshd restart, it will restart service.
giving sudo access to ansible user, give sudo visudo,
## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
ansible  ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL
ec2-user  ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL

login ansible user like sudo su anisble, required to install python, sudo yum install python3-pip -y,(It's a python package manager)
Update package Manager
sudo yum update -y
install EPEL Repository on RHEL
sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
confirm EPEL installation
sudo dnf repolist epel
Ansible Towe user Ansible playbook to deploy itself so we also need ansible installed.
sudo yum -y install ansible vim curl

sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2
ansible --version
python --version
