Git commands
================
open Git Bash  --> windows
connecting to linux server  --> git --version
cd ~/Desktop --> Windows
cd ~ --> home directory in linux server
mkdir wallmart
cd wallmart
pwd --> present working directory

git init  --> git init is command to creates a empty git local repository 

Working Area                   Sageing Area                                   Local Repo
----------------------------------------------------------------
vi employtee.java 

git status --> check whether local stageing working area file will check
                             -------->                                   ------>git commit -m "first commit
                            git add .           all files going to move
                           git add *              all files going to move
                         git add employtee.java     one file going to move
git add  --> moving from Working Area to Sageing Area  

git commit -m "first commit" --> all the files moving from local repo to remote repo which are in staging area

who you are?

git config --global user.name "snaveen457"
git config --global user.email "snaveenapt457@gmail.com"

git config --global --list         ---> check the names 

untracked file (Red Colour) --> the files which are available in working place those called untracked file
tracked file (Green Colour) --> the files which are available in staging area those called tracked file

git remote add   wm --> git remote add is a command to map your remote repository with local repository.

wm --> alais name for the remote repo url

git remote -v --> check whether which url is mapped

git push aliasname branchname --> pushing the code from local repo to remote repo
git push wm master

how many commid id's are there waht is command?
git log

head is showing latest commit id

commit id
vcs  version control system

particular commited id how many files create how to see?
git show commit id

git show --pretty="" --name-only commit id       it will show file names

git commit -a( only modified file) -m "update users file"  --> when already existing file weupdate that time will execute.

git reset --> what ever files which are in staging area it is going to revert back to the working area
git reset filename      --> particular file revert it back from staging area to working area


in which badly commited code remove that code
----------------------------------------------
git revert --> what ever commited id is going to pause, in that commit id what ever files are created newly 
         those are going to delete and what ever files are updated updated content is  going to be deleted.

once hit the git revert it will open window in that add reverted.. and save it.

what is difference between git reset and git revert?

can we use git revert for older commit as well?
A) no

.gitignore
===========
some times we don't want to commit the  files, which are generated by IDElike .project and .classpath files or 
some node module folders like node_module folder into a git repository.
to ignore these files and folders to commit we will create one file called .gitignore and we will keep the files names or directory names which we don't want to commit as follows.

IDE(Integrated development environment)
Exlipse
.classpath
.project
My Eclipse
Intellij
Visual studio Code
node_modules
Atom

Branches
==========
git branch   --> it will display how many branches is there

git branch branchname(development)   --> for creating branch command

git checkout branchname(development)    --> switched to the one branch to another branch
> 
git coomit -a -m  "updated code"   --> it is already file updated code then only it possible

git diff development

git merge development   --> merge purpose what ever code one branch to another branch

git checkout -b branchname   ---> crating branch and switch to that branch one time

git push wm(aliasname) --all  --> we can push the all branches from local repo to remote repo
git push wm(aliasname) stage development   --> individual pushing branches

git conflicts  --> when you are going to get the merge conflicts?
                  when you are going to integrate one brach to another branch with same files same lines is updated in line that time it is going to merge conflicts
