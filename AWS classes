Storage services
==================
EBS -->block storage   EBS Additional storage capacity 16384GB
EFS -->file system
s3 --> object storage

storage types
==============
Block storage --> the data(file) will be spilt into a equally distributed blocks and save as ablocks in the storage.
advantage: performance, read and write performance.
EBS Additional storage capacity 16384GB
root EBS storage support 1023GB

IOPS--> input output operations seconds

file storage or file system --> treditional file systems,
it will maintain as single entity
either block storage or file storage we have to attach to the instance we have mount to the file system then only wecan use.

object storage --> we can access data from any where without mounting the storage to server.
                   each object which we will upload to object storage will have uniqueID and URL(HTTP(S)) endpoint.


create instance,automatically EBS it will store some default value,give lsblk it will show how many block storage have,root file system.
go to volume, create volume, give siz3 5 gb, select availability zone 1a, give tag name,create volume.
attch created volume, go to actions,select attach volume,select running instance,select attach volume.
then verfication go to ec2 instance, check volumes use coomand lsblk,it will show two volumes.
created new volume before use you need to format and if you want, do partions and mount the volume.
check file system in ec2 instance using command file -s /dev/xvdf it will show output dev/xvdf: data
check file system in ec2 instance using command file -s /dev/xvda1 it will show output /dev/xvda1: SGI XFS filesystem data (blksz 4096, inosz 512, v2 dirs)
create file system in ec2 instance using command like mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf and enter.
df -kh use this command volume mounted or not.create directory mkdir ebsdemo,mount coomand mount /dev/xvdf ebsdemo/
create a file vi ebsdemo/test.txt give comment,
in real time, jenkins storage in additional volume.
if you want add more volume, go to actions, select modify volume, give size 5 to 10 and give modify.
root volume and additional volume how to take backup, select this volume,create snapshot,give name for snapshot.


create additional volume and use
==================================
1)create EBS volume
2) Attach EBS Volume 
3) create a filesysytem (format)
ext3,ext4
4)Mount volume with directory (saving temporary)
5) save in fstab  (saving permenently)


restore data from the snapshot
==============================
1)create avolume
2) Attach volume 
3)mount that volume
4)save in fstab



what is the maximum capacity of 1 EBS Volume?
16TB or 16384 GB

can we change volume size & type while it is in use?
yes we can change, we can change the volume type. we can increase volume you no nedd to shutdown the server.

create volume from the snapshot can we do file system?
no, if i create again file sysytem data will be loss.

what is replication and migration?
replication--> duplicating maintain two servers, 
Migration --> we are moving one data center to another data center.


AWs infrstructure.
=======================
hardware --. cpu memory storage,networks
servers -->
on premise data centers
aws cloud provider it's providing infrstructure,servers,storage,networks,softewares.

how to attach snapshot to another server
=============================================
create one more instance in 1b availabityzone.login
from the snapshot create volume, go to snapshot,go to action, select create volume from snapshot and create.
go to voulmes, attach this volume, select 1b avilability zone,and create.
after attaching volume, mount the volume, before create one directory in 1b zone,mount /dev/xvdf testsnap/
file -s .dev/xvdf for checking file system.
